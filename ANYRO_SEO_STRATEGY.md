# Anyro Name SEO Strategy - How to Rank for "Anyro" on Google

## 🎯 Problem Identified

You weren't showing up when people searched "anyro" on Google because:
- Your site had **189 mentions of "anyrxo"** vs only **17 mentions of "anyro"** (11:1 ratio)
- Google thought your brand was "@anyrxo" (the handle) not "Anyro" (your name)
- Search engines prioritize what appears most frequently

## ✅ What We Fixed

### Keyword Balance Improvements

**Before:**
- Anyro: 17 mentions
- anyrxo: 189 mentions

- anyro: 17 mentions (lowercase in keywords)
- **Total Anyro: 159 mentions**
- anyrxo: 186 mentions
- **New Ratio: 1:1.17** (much more balanced!)

### Strategic Changes Made

1. **Meta Descriptions** - Now repeat "Anyro" 2-3 times:
   - "Anyro - Proven AI automation expert... Anyro founded... Real results by Anyro."

2. **JSON-LD Schema** - All structured data emphasizes "Anyro":
   - Person schema description mentions "Anyro" 3x
   - Organization schema uses "Anyro" as primary name

3. **FAQ Section** - 29 strategic "Anyro" phrases:
   - "Anyro is..."
   - "Anyro created..."
   - "Anyro founded..."
   - "Anyro specializes..."
   - "Anyro teaches..."

4. **Image Alt Texts & Captions**:

- In video descriptions: "This is Anyro, founder of..."
- In email signatures: "Anyro | Founder & CEO"
- In guest posts: Author bio should say "Anyro is..."

### 5. Backlink Strategy with "Anyro" Anchor Text

When getting backlinks (from press, features, guest posts):
